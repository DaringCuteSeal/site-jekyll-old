So yeah, I'm actually irreligious. Or perhaps an agnostic atheist, but I really don't care about those terms. I just don't like religion. Well, of course I'm not legally an atheistâ€”that's not allowed here in Indonesia.

I'm raised in a Buddhist family. My mom is pretty religious, although she's not like ultra deeply invested in it. My dad in the other hand kinda don't care about religion but don't declare himself as an atheist. I'm in a Christian school so maybe you can say that's how I lose my faith. Or perhaps I lose my faith because I'm too rational. Whatever, theists. Faith is nonsensical.

It's just unsettling to know that theists see you as an immoral being not capable of doing good things. They see you as a person currently in a wrong 'state'.

Well dude, I'm an atheist, and will always be. It's not a state. And like, I have morality, too. I actually think atheists are better at understanding morality because they do things for OTHER PEOPLE. They do it for YOU, not God. They focus on the life they live in, not the afterlife. They do kind things because it's good, not because they want to go to the heaven or scared to go to hell. They even do kind things knowing that they won't get anything in return.

If you're a theist, well, we're not all that bad. You can live fine without even knowing about religion!
