GRUB disappeared after some reboots..

<small>So, uh, this is just a little story that I wanted to post like a year ago.. so, uh, you know, not relatively recent.</small>

<small>P.S this is the last blog post I'll be writing for a while, it's almost my final test (and I'm frustrated tbh)..</small>


At June 28 (2021), I tried the LTS kernel. I didn't remember why, probably some hardware issues. Anyway, I thought it would be better but it's pretty much the same. I messed around for a while, and then.. after a couple reboots, my GRUB suddenly disappears. I was like, "What the heck? I didn't do anything!" Not a big deal, since I could fix that in 2 mins but I really wonder why. There's no way my SSD is dying, since it was just 3 months old back then. So yeah, I reinstalled GRUB and it was fine. Uncool.

You'd think that's the end? Well noâ€”at January 13th (2022, and also my Linux anniversary), it happened again!
