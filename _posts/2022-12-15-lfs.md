title: LFS!
postdesc: Finally, I've built LFS sucessfully!!

# Yay!
Finally, my LFS worked! Named him Lufus, cuz like, "LuFuS". It took me 2 days to set up everything lol. And I built this the same day I compiled Gentoo a year ago (12 December) :D

# A Crazy Hybrid
My system isn't that usefulâ€”the amount of errors my LFS has is horrendous, like:
- I couldn't suspend the system properly (on my G400s laptop and Gaming 3 laptop)
- A file system error (not sure about it) during boot (both laptop)
- My Wi-Fi card not working (on my Gaming 3 laptop)
- ...more

Plus, since it was compiled on my Gaming 3 laptop, using Lufus on my G400s makes a crazy hybrid mess. No, I didn't optimize any code, but I probably missed some configuration flags. For now, I'm unable to compile programs with my G400s laptop. I probably have to set some flag during GCC configuration and then recompile it, but nah, who has time for that. This is enough, for now. At least I can ping a website xD

# Day 1
Started on morning, everything was working pretty smoothly. The only twist was... I mistakenly compiled (the temporary one, luckily) glibc (I think) on my host system instead of my LFS. Good thing I didn't broke my host system.

# Day 2
## Stripping Cheat
On the stripping part my second self was like, "back it up!!!" but I ignored it... 

And when I was stripping my binaries I met this error:

```
strip: error while loading shared libraries: /usr/lib/libz.so.1: file too short
```

And turns out it's because I didn't pay attention to the book errata xd I mean yea I've checked it before but I didn't pay attention again. 

I'm supposed to replace the libz version to libz.so.1.2.13 like this:
```bash
online_usrbin="Bash find strip"
online_usrlib="libbfd-2.39.so
               libhistory.so.8.1
               libncursesw.so.6.3
               libm.so.6
               libreadline.so.8.1
               libz.so.1.2.13
......
```

The stripping failed and a lot of my programs broke because libz.so.1 became empty or something like that. I tried rebuilding zlib but I couldn't because you need zlib to compile zlib. Ya. I then compiled zlib with my host system and then installed it with `make DESTDIR=/mnt/LFS install` and then recompile zlib through my LFS system again. It works and I don't have to wait another 5 months to install LFS again! (I hate repeating something and I need to take a break first).

## Booting
My first boot shows a blank screen. But of course I didn't give up ;)

I suck at kernel stuff. I don't understand 90% of the kernel configuration ToT and so I ended up copying [Arch](https://archlinux.org)'s kernel configuration, modifying it a little, and then compile my kernel. I also made an initial ramdisk with my host system and recompile kmod to support zstd kernel module compression.

And yes it worked. Sort of. Many errors. But still works nevertheless.
