title: Data Lost v.2
---

Yet another data loss! Or.. 2 more actually. Yes, I caused it.

My mom had a new (Android) phone and long story short I had to move some of her images on her old phone to her new one. I used cables™ since they're much faster—but it's so hard as it keeps failing for some reason. I kept retrying until.. I realized that everything except for a folder called "Android" was gone on the new phone—and the worst part: on the SD card inside too! I thought that was an error but it's \*actually\* gone!

I turned off the phone and yanked the SD card and continued to fsck that thing. It's fine, that doesn't look like some kind of data corruption. I then used [testdisk](https://www.cgsecurity.org/index.html?testdisk.html) to analyze the (FAT32) partition there. There was an option for undeleting, and it found EVERYTHING, like literally EVERYTHING. Phew. Oh and that includes some files and directories with gibberish name.

And yesterday, I also (kind of, not quite me though) messed up a USB drive. More on that later. There's a math test tomorrow and I'm typing this instead of studying lol.
