title: A Better "Metaverse"
postdesc: Meta's Metaverse is a nightmare, isn't it?
---

There's a talkshow about (probably Meta's?) Metaverse today. Basically, they showed some negative sides of it and showed some school and church rooms there. It's like an advertisement lol. Listening to it actually makes me feel a little pissed off, but hey, I have a better idea that probably other people have thinked of.

Instead of a single company providing a service, what if we just have a decentralized pool of universes hosted by many people around the world? There will be a nice secure encrypted protocol that a universe will be built on. And instead of only having a single client to connect to the all the universes, we can build our own clients! Diversity! And also, more privacy and better security!
