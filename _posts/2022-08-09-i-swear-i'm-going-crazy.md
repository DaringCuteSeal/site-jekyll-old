title: I Swear That I'm Going Crazy.
postdesc: A stupid thing I did in my first day of extracurricular

---

Don't worry, I'm still alive.

Alright so basically, today is the first day of my animation extracurricular.

I went to my classroom. It was normal.

And then, we were shown a slideshow about what animation is, some of the examples.. you know, eh, pretty basic stuff. And guess what? The "2D animation" example is about something entirely random that straight up looks like a gen Z humor. I laughed so hard that I couldn't even breath. Wow, that was a nice presentation.

And then, at the end, we were told that we are going to use Blender for making our animations. I instantly freaked out since this is basically what I've always wanted since 2018. But yeah, nothing much.

Until, we were asked whether some of us have ever used Blender. I have no idea why but I instantly raised my hand while screaming a bit. The entire class laughed so hard. Damn. I can't believe I actually did that.

But yeah, basically, my dream came true! Back in the fourth grade, in my computer extracurricular and IT subject, I'd always bring a USB stick which has Blender on it, and use Blender at my school computers whenever possible. I'd usually finish my assignment as quick as possible so I could have some time with Blender, ahah.
