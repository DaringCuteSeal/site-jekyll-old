title: Finally, IT'S OVER!

YES! IT'S OVER! FINALLY!

The test has been done since two days ago, but there was a math re-test at my school yesterday because, apparently, our score sucks (probably). Ahh.. I can finally have enough sleep now. I'm going to have a nice long holiday.

Anyways, I can finally try to get a working [LFS](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org) install! Wish good luck for me. I will also draw (digitally) a bit more, continue my wallpapers project, learn GeoNodes.. and probably learn C, JavaScript, AND ALSO RUST a bit more! I'm not feeling very motivated rn, but let's hope I soon will. Not gonna waste this opportunity.
