<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi!! So.. I'm Pearl&mdash;well actually that's my nickname, but I just liked to be called that way. You can find me under the username "Daringcuteseal" or "Mysticreator" across the internet. I'm 13, and I live in Indonesia. I enjoy art and programming. I'm primarily a 3D (Blender) artist, even though I actually am learning how to draw digitally in 2D and I have a lot of free time to code too.</p>
