# OS's

Systems that I own.

## Matt
Unpacked on December 12th, 2021. Just a normal Gentoo system I kept around after being played for a month. Have no idea when I last upgraded it so if I run `emerge sync && emerge -auDN @world` now it'll last a day or so.

## Lyra
An Ubuntu Touch. Installed on June 16th, 2022. Successfully installed after months of trying. Installed on my Asus ZenFone.

## Artix
Bootstrapped on June 14th, 2021. I thought she's going to be the last system to be daily driven but I'm wrong. Yeah she didn't have a name sadly :( Right now installed on my IdeaPad G400s.

## W11

A normal W11. I rarely touch it. No screenshot since it's just a default W11 desktop. You can search how it looks on the internet.
